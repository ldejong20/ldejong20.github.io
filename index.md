### CPSC 120


* Lab 1
  
	 Lab 1 was a favorite because it marked the start of my journey into
    computer science. While the contents of this lab are not very
    complicated, and the task it solves is rudimentary at best, it serves
    as a good launching point for all my future work in computer science.
    It’s simple, easy to follow, and serves as a baseline for future labs.
    It introduced the basics, such as std::cout, something that would appear
    in most if not all future labs.


* Lab 6
  
	The first part of Lab 6 was a favorite because it showed an accumulation of
  everything that had been learned so far. Using if statements, double variables,
  and vectors, the program was able to find the Olympic average of scores. This lab
  was more difficult that Lab 1, but ultimately a solution was reached.


* Lab 9
  
	The second part of Lab 9 is the other lab that I liked the most. The use of Booleans 
  in combination with if statements and strings allowed for the program to answer a 
  variation on the dining philosophers’ problem. This lab took a lot of work to try and 
  figure out, and the ability to call out specific arguments within a command prompt 
  input is something that would be handy in future labs.
